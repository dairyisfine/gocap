# GoCap - Simple Capture Card Helper For Lightweight Systems

GoCap is a simple Go application intended for use on lightweight systems such as a Raspberry Pi. The main goal of this project is to provide a simple solution to capturing video and audio from a capture device to the attached storage without the need for a screen or other peripherals.

GoCap is a web interface for controlling the recording of video via a separate mobile device connected wirelessly to a Raspberry Pi (or similar device). 

#### This is meant to function on Linux based systems ONLY, and requires the following software to be installed:

* ffmpeg (of course!)
* alsa
* v4l-utils

#### Please note that this software is still very early and is no where near usable at the moment. Current development is targetting a Raspberry Pi 4 using a basic AV capture device, as that matches my personal needs at the moment.
